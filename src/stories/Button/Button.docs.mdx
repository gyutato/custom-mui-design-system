## Button

#### Buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.

Buttons communicate actions that users can take. They are typically placed throughout your UI, in places like:

- Modal windows
- Forms
- Cards
- Toolbars

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Basic} />
<Controls />

## [Usage](#usage)

- Buttons may contain icon, on the left or the right side
- Use 8 px spacing between buttons
- Replace text with a loader if action is submitted, but still processing
- Button width is set by itâ€™s content, avoid changing it width
- Use only one primary button, and any remaining calls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons
